# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
    \nMy name is Yuchen Liu and I also go by Eric. My pronouns are He/Him/His. My favorite types of games are RPG and Sandbox games. For most of other genres, I also have some experience with, though I'm not a pro in playing video games. I take this course not only because I'm a GDIM major, but also because I feel that knowing how to program games provides significant help in designing games. I've developed a first-person puzzle game before with Unity. Puzzle game is what I hope to build because I think puzzles can be great component for many games though they are difficult to make.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [*] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
    Out of this class, I hope I could learn some interesting algorithms in make games and make some friends.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
    I'm a little nervous about team working in this class.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
    C++, C#, Java

2. Game development (any engine)
    A first-person puzzle game that supports 1-2 hours of play.

3. Unity
    Basic knowledge of how to use Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
    The outline document written before actually starting programming the game. This document includes both high-level and low-level designs.

2. Scope management
    N/A

3. Iteration
    Iteration is a software development pattern, where developers follow the loop of designing, developing, and public testing.

4. Object-Oriented programming
    OOP is a programming pattern. Its main idea is to write code or programs that users only have to know how to use and don't need to consider how they work.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
    N/A
